# Docker MCP Gateway Catalog Entry for Google Workspace MCP (Local)
#
# This catalog entry configures Google Workspace MCP as a remote HTTP server
# for Docker MCP Gateway. The server manages its own OAuth flow using your
# Google OAuth credentials (provided in .env file).
#
# Usage:
#   docker mcp catalog import ./workspace-mcp-local-catalog.yaml
#   docker mcp server enable google-workspace
#
# Note: You must provide your own Google OAuth Client ID/Secret in .env
# OAuth authorization is triggered when you first call a tool.
